# BeeIR-Sensor Library

Arduino Library for BeeIR and all of other analog IR sensors. The Library can output analog sensors values as a boolean values. the sensor values is greater than programmer provided threshold value then output is 1 and sensor value is minor than threshold value then output is 0.

## BeeIR-Sensor

BeeIR sensor is a TCRT5000 based 8 sensor array board. Which it is provides 8 analog outputs to user. BeeIR have a preset controller to the adjust IR led brightnes.
